Modelling and sentence classification with convolutional neural networks.

This project is based on the work of Nal Kalchbrenner, Edward Grefenstette, Phil Blunsom [A Convolutional Neural Network for Modelling Sentences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2188) and the one of Yoon Kim [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882v2)
